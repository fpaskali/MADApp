## Introduction
The Microarray Data Analysis App (MADApp) is a shiny application for microarrays data analysis. It offers various modules, for image acquisition, editing, label loading, background correction with multiple available methods, false positive detection of the spots, post-processing, checkerboard measurement overview and time series plotting. It is designed using a sidebar or two-column layout consisting of a structured side panel and a main visualisation and plotting area. The side panel consolidates all the critical parameters and controls necessary for loading files and fine tuning, enabling the users to dynamically adjust input variables, and modify visualization settings in real-time. On the other hand, the broader main section serves as the primary workspace where users can interact with complex biomedical datasets, explore trends, patterns, and visualize the results in high detail. These foster better visualization and optimize interactivity. The analysis workflow is organised in logical steps, each of which is presented within one of the seven tabs.

## Tab 1: Image Editor
The first tab contains the image editing module, in which an image can be loaded and adjusted for analysis (Figure 1).

### Date of test and ID

In **Date of Test** the time stamp can be set. By default, the system date is used. Additionally, a unique **ID** can be set when working with microarrays having same time stamp. The date and ID hav to be unique, in order to add the measurements to the intensity data. Specifying the test date and ID is important step, that is crucial for correct **Time Series** plotting ([Tab 7: Time Series]).

### Load Image or Sample

To start analysis, an image has to be loaded or for trying out the application one can use the provided sample image. After loading, the image is displayed on the main plot and the user can zoom or rotate the image, and finally adjust the grid to proceed with the analysis. For the purpose of demonstration we will use the sample image provided with the package. Standard image types, such as PNG, JPEG and TIFF are supported.

### Rotate Image

In the rotation panel a fine rotation can be performed, for maximum 45 degrees in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise). For more precise control, it is recommended to use arrow keys on your keyboard, after selecting the slider. The image can be also rotated 90 degrees, flipped horizontally and vertically, using respective buttons:

|       Transformation        | Button |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| 90 degrees counterclockwise |   -90  |
| 90 degrees clockwise        |   +90  |
| Flip horizontally           |   FH   |
| Flip vertically             |   FV   |

### Grid parameters

In the **Grid parameters** panel, **Number of rows** and **Number of columns** in the grid can be adjusted. Additionally, there are two grid modes, **Rectangular** and **Parallelogram**, covering different types of arrays.

After loading the image, one needs to click on the image in the main plot and drag to define the grid. Additionally, one can zoom to the selected region by double-clicking in the selection box on the plot. The zoom level and selection can be reversed by using **Reset** button. Furthermore, the grid parameters can be adjusted before or during the selection. An example of a well selected cropping region is shown in the following screenshot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap="Figure 1: Overview of the image editing module"}
knitr::include_graphics("../preview/preview_1.png")
```

By clicking **Apply Grid** button the selected region is cropped and the analysis proceeds to the next step. To undo all changes and start the from scratch analysis, press **Reset** button.

## Tab 2: Annotation

In the annotation tab, the cropped region of interest with a checkerboard grid is printed in the main plot. In this tab, the user can choose to load an already saved comma separated values (CSV) file containing the annotation information, modify an existing or create a new annotation for the array.

### Load Label File

A comma separated value file (CSV file) containing the annotation information may be loaded here. A annotation information is not mandatory to continue the analysis, but not analysis steps can be performed without annotation data. The label file should be CSV file, consisting of two columns without header. The first column shows the cell name (e.g. A11), and the second the analyte name. At the moment, the application is limited to 30 x 30 matrices, hence the cell name can be any letter / two letters from A to AD (e.g A, B, C ... AA, AB ...), and the number can be any number from 1 to 30. But it can be easily modified to work with 702 x 702 or larger matrices.

### Remove Labels

By clicking on this button label information can be removed from the analysis.

### Save Labels

Label will be saved in a CSV File and the file can be later used in another analysis.

### Add Analyte

If the users wants to create a analyte list from scratch or want to extend the analyte list with new custom name, this can be done by assigning analyte name and adding it to the list by clicking on **Add Analyte** button. To define an analyte on the grid, first the analyte has to be selected in the Select Analyte element and click the desired field in the main plot.

When the analyte name is selected in the **Select Analyte** box, the analyte marker(s) will be shown on the grid with green color in the cells where this analyte is present.

### Hide Analyte Markers

Analyte markers on the grid can also be hidden, to have better overview of the spots in the original image. This can be done by clicking **Hide analyte markers**. To show them again, **Show analyte markers** can be selected.

However, not all analysis steps can be performed without annotation data. When the annotation is finished, or if one chooses to skip this step, one has to click **Apply Segmentation** and the analysis will proceed to the next step.

## Tab 3: Background Correction

In the background correction tab, one of the threshold methods is carried out to reduce signal to noise ratio and extract the signal from the background.

### Color image?

The application is designed to perform background correction and extract intensities from grayscale images. Therefore, when working with a standard three-channel colour image, either a specific channel must be selected, or the image must first be converted to grayscale. For this, two approaches can be employed, luminance and grayscale. In the luminance method, the red, green and blue (RGB) channels are weighted and summed according to the formula 0.2126 x R + 0.7152 x G + 0.0722 x B. In the grayscale method, the channels are equally weighted and summed using the formula 1/3 x R + 1/3 x G + 1/3 x B.

### Spot Type
Depending on the type of microarray used, one of the two type of spots can be chosen: dark spot on the light background or light spot on dark background.

### Select threshold method and apply
The background that is subtracted from the image can be computed using two algorithms: Otsu and quantile. Otsu is an automatic image thresholding method that selects an optimal threshold based on the discriminant criterion. This threshold can be computed globally, using information from all cells, or locally, for each cell individually. The second method, quantile, is a semi-automatic method that computes an empirical quantile from the intensity values of each cell. The computed threshold is used to separate the signal from the background in each cell.

By clicking **Apply Background Correction** the selected threshold method is applied to each cell of the microarray grid. After the thresholding method is applied, two plots and a table containing information are displayed in the main panel of the third tab (Figure 2). The plot on the left side shows the pixels above the threshold, while the plot on the right displays the signal after background subtraction. Additionally, the displayed table shows the calculated intensities alongside the threshold data for each cell of the array. 

To proceed to the post processing step **Proceed to Post-Processing** has to be selected.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap="Figure 2: Overview of the background correction module"}
knitr::include_graphics("../preview/preview_2.png")
```

## Tab 4: Post-processing

### Optional: False Positive Spots Detection

In the post-processing tab, the cells with false positive spot (produced by either artifacts or spot leakage in the adjacent cell) will be automatically detected by the algorithm and marked on the screen with purple dot. The algorithm calculates the ratio of pixels above the background to the total number of pixels within each cell and compares this ratio to a user-defined threshold.The default threshold value is 0.2, meaning that any cell with less than 20 percent valid pixels will be marked as false positive. The process is interactive, allowing the user to adjust the threshold to determine the most appropriate value. Additionally, each cell can be manually adjusted after visual inspection. For these field to be excluded from the analysis, **Exclude false positives** has to be selected.

### Optinal: Scaling and signal refinement

Another optional step is scaling and signal refinement, in which the extracted intensities are transformed to fit within a range between zero (indicating no signal), and one (indication the highest intensity) (Figure 3). The 0.9 empirical quantile of background (empty) cells, specified in **Choose Empty IDs** representing IDs of Negative control or Empty Fields, is used to filter out noise and artefacts, while the 0.1 empirical quantile of positive control cells, specified in **Choose Positive Control IDs** representing IDs of Positive control Fields. This is achieve using a modified min-max scaling algorithm, x' = (x - MIN) / MAX, where MIN is a 0.9 empirical qunatile of one or multiple empty cells, and MAX is a 0.1 empirical quantile of on or more cells with the highest intensity. Transformed intensities below zero are excluded, while those above one are set to one. In order to use and apply this changes **Scale data** has to be checked.

Finally, the post-processed data can be added to the intensity data table, by clicking **Add to Data** and the user can proceed with the analysis of another array. Additionally, a HTML report can also be generated (**Generate Report**) that summarises the key analysis results and includes details of all pre-processing steps, the parameters applied and system information, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap="Figure 3: Overview of the post-processing tab"}
knitr::include_graphics("../preview/preview_3.png")
```

Clicking **Show Intensity Data** changes the active tab to Intensity Data.

## Tab 5: Intensity Data
The intensity data tab displays a table containing intensity data extracted from the microarrays. This step is also an optional starting step, as previously exported intensity data can be loaded for use in the next two steps. Additionally, the intensity data can be saved as a CSV file or deleted, in which case the analysis can be started from the beginning using a fresh application state. The table contains the following information: date and ID of the analysis, file name, colour conversion mode, thresholding method, grid cell, analyte name, mean and median measurements, and threshold used for background correction.  Each table column can be sorted and filtered.

### Load Intensity Data

Load a CSV file containing Intensity Data from previous analysis.

### Delete Intensity Data

This button can be used to delete the current intensity data and start over.

### Save Intensity Data

The generated intensity data can be saved in CSV file.

## Tab 6: Checkerboard Overview
In the checkerboard tab (Figure 4), the intensity table is used to visualise a measurement in a checkerboard-like table, showing the mean or median intensity, or threshold for each cell. The date and measurement ID of the microarray can be specified in the sidebar, together with an analyte to mark the cell in which it was used. Additionally, the heatmap feature can be used to colour code the table and indicate cells with high intensity. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap="Figure 4: Overview of checkerboard tab"}
knitr::include_graphics("../preview/preview_4.png")
```

## Tab 7: Time Series

In the final tab, Time Series Visualization (Figure 5), one can specify a time period and an analyte to produce a visualisation of analyte intensity over time in the cells where the analyte was used, as well as the average analyte intensity across all cells.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap="Figure 5: Overview of time series tab"}
knitr::include_graphics("../preview/preview_5.png")
```
